# NematodeMovementAnalysis_v1
A pipeline to extract and analyze body postures from recordings of crawling C. elegans worms.

  ## Introduction
  This is a compilation of MATLAB scripts to identify individual C. elegans worms in recordings and analyze the posture dynamics.
  This script has been used in the publication "The First of Us: Ophiocordyceps use a novel scramblase-binding peptide to manipulate zombie ants" by WC Beckerson et al.
  The pipeline includes the following steps:
  1)


  ## Tutorial
  The tutorial illustrates the use of the whole pipeline. We provide example data of WT C. elegans worms (to be precise: young adult worms of the CGC1 strain, previously fed with RosettaTM 2 bacteria transformed with the empty pET-22b vector). The example data constitutes 1 min recording of multiple worms on an NGM plate.
